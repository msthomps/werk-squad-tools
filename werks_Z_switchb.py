'''
This script is a flowchart for calculating metallicity using the techniques as described in Pettini &
Pagel. The script uses functions written by the members of Werk SQuAD. Initially the script prompts the
user for a data-file path to be input. The script then searches for all '-99.0' values in the data and
changes them to 'np.nan' (NaN) values. The script then carries out the necessary sorting and calculations
to attain metallicity (Z) values using O3N2, N2, and R23 (Pettini Pagel 2004). This script also merges the
input file with the 'cgmsq_allsurveys_cgmsystable.fits' data-file before prompting the user to input a
file path, and name, to save the final DataFrame to.
